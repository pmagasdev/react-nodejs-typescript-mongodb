# Note
Note that basically the code is almost empty including mostly the folder of each project structure. The docker compose also works correctly synching th back-end, mongo db and front-end.

Run the following command in the project root directory to start the application:

```bash
docker-compose up --build

# Run below command if previous command shouldn't fail.
docker-compose down -v
```

## Frontend (React, TypeScript Redux, Axios, Docker)):

## Backend (NodeJS, Express, Typescript, Docker):
